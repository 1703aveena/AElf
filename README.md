# Development Roadmap

## Phase1 : inner affair

1. A graph-based scheduler algorithm implementation.
2. Tagged primitive resource Data-Structure(sstable a.k.a. sorted string table), the basic element for resource isolation, backed by distributed KV database, this structure is comparable to dataflow processing paradigm(like mr/reactivex).
3. In-cluster wire protocol(data/task marshal/unmarshal).
4. Actor(eg. akka) based task distribution inside a single cluster/ledger.
5. A contract for demostration of concurrent execution.

## Phase2 : between ledger nodes

1. tx_pool/mem_pool design(unconfirmed tx).
2. basic block in-memory construct, eg: merkletree, block header, transactions, statsdb, caching.
3. wire protocol for inter-ledger block/tx transfering.
4. dPoS implementation, hashing, mining.
5. block validator, crypto related algorithms, eg signing, hmac.
6. p2p discovery/communication

## Phase3: the mainchain

1. crosschainï¼Œtwo-way peg
2. event trigger from one sidechain to another, a.k.a cross chain interoperability.
