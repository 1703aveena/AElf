# Election Contract

The Election contract is essentially used for voting for Block Producers.

## **an Election for choosing Block Producers**:

To be a Block Producer, user should register to be a candidate first. Besides, as a candidate, the user should pay 100000 ELF as a deposit. If the data center is not full, the user will be added in automatically and get one weight(10 weight limited)for sharing bonus in the future.

```Protobuf
rpc AnnounceElection (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {}
```

## **QuitElection**

Although you have been a candidate, you are able to quit the election given that you are not a miner. If you quit successfully, you can get your deposite backï¼Œ and you will lose your weight to get bonus in the future.

```Protobuf
rpc QuitElection (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {}
```

## **Vote**

Vote a candidate to be elected. The token you vote will be locked till the end time. According to the number of token you voted and its lock time, you can get corresponding weight for sharing the bonus in the future.
```Protobuf
rpc Vote (VoteMinerInput) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {}

message VoteMinerInput {
    string candidate_pubkey = 1;
    sint64 amount = 2;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp end_timestamp = 3;
}
```

**VoteMinerInput**:
- **candidate pubkey**: candidate public key
- **amount**: amount token to vote
- **end timestamp**: before which, your vote works.

## **ChangeVotingOption**

Before the end time, you are able to change your vote target to other candidates.

Q: public key, address
```Protobuf
rpc ChangeVotingOption (ChangeVotingOptionInput) returns google.protobuf.Empty){}

message ChangeVotingOptionInput {
    aelf.Hash vote_id = 1;
    string candidate_pubkey = 2;
}
```

**ChangeVotingOptionInput**:
- **voting vote id**: transaction id.
- **candidate pubkey**: new candidate public key

## **Withdraw**

After the lock time, your deposit token will be unlocked, and you can withdraw them.

```Protobuf
rpc Withdraw (aelf.Hash) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {}

message Hash
{
    bytes value = 1;
}
```

**Hash**:
- **value**: transaction id
