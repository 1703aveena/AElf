Welcome to AElf's official documentation. This Gitbook is where we centralize our guides, documents and api references. Weither you're a dApp developper looking to build some awesome apps on top of AElf or simply just interested in seeing what a running node looks like, this place is for you!

As of today the documentation is correct but still in progress so we invite you to frequently visit and discover any new content.

If you've never run a node before, we invite you to go through the "Getting started" section. It will give you the necessary basic knowledge and a few commands to run a node.
