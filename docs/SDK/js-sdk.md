For dApp developpers we have a javascript sdk, to help interaction with the JSON RPC exposed by the node. Of course, you need to run a an AELF node to use the sdk.

If you need more information you can check out the repo : [aelf-sdk.js](https://github.com/AElfProject/aelf-sdk.js)

We also have some demos that you can use as examples to build your own dApps
[here](https://github.com/AElfProject/aelf-sdk.js/tree/master/demos).
