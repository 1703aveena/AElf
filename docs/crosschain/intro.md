## introduction

Side chains were introduced to handle various commercial scenarios, itâ€™s envisioned that one sidechain is designed for one or multiple similar business scenarios, distributing different tasks on multiple chains and improving processing efficiency.

Conceptually a side chain node and mainchain node are similar, they are both independent blockchains, with their own peer-to-peer network and possibly their own ecosystem. It is even possible to have this setup on multiple levels. In terms of peer-to-peer networks, all side chains work in parallel to each other but they are linked to a mainchain node through a cross-chain communication mechanism.

Through this link, messages are exchanged and indexing is performed to ensure that transactions from the main are verifiable in the sidechain. Implementers can use AElf libraries and frameworks to build chains.
