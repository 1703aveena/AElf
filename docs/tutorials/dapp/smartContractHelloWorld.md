# Smart Contract

This article will guide you through how to use **AElf Boilerplate** project to implement and test a smart contract. This guide assumes you have completed the previous [Setup](setup.md) tutorial.

## Introduction

### Setup

To easily follow this tutorial you will need to open the the **AElf Boilerplate** root folder in Visual Studio Code and also open the **Integrated Terminal**.

In the previous image you can see that the repository is composed of a **chain** and a **web** folder. The following content will help you understand the content of the **chain** folder.

### Folder structure

This section will introduce you to the structure of a smart contract developed with **Boilerplate** by introducing the *Hello World*  contract example. Here's an overview of the folders and files you will find in the **chain** folder:

- **protobuf**: contains some protobuf message definitions, some common to all contracts, some for specific contracts.
- scripts: build scripts - not important for this guide.
- **src**:
  - AElf.Boilerplate.Launcher: console project to launch the node.
  - AElf.Boilerplate.Mainchain: a library for the node.
  - **HelloWorldContract**: the implementation of the Hello World contract.
- **test**:
  - **HelloWorldContract.Test**: the tests for the Hello World contract.

This guide will focus on the **HelloWorldContract** and **HelloWorldContract.Test** folders since the code we will modify is located in these.

### Hello World contract

#### Definition and implementation

**Definition**: in AElf contracts are defined as services and are implemented using protobuf. Let's take a look at the **hello_world.proto** file located in the **protobuf/** folder:

```bash
syntax = "proto3";

import "aelf_options.proto";
import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";

option csharp_namespace = "HelloWorldContract";

service HelloWorldContract {

    option (aelf.csharp_state) = "HelloWorldContractState";

    rpc Hello (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (HelloReturn) { }
}

message HelloReturn {
    string Value = 1;
}
```

It's a simple contract that defines one method **Hello** and one type **HelloReturn**. We won't go through every detail of the definition, for this you can check out the [Smart Contract section](../../Contract/main.md) of this Gitbook.

**Implementation**: 

The implementation is located in the **src/HelloWorldContract** folder, it contains two important files: the **state* and the **service implentation**.

```csharp
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;

namespace HelloWorldContract
{
    public partial class HelloWorldContract : HelloWorldContractContainer.HelloWorldContractBase
    {
        public override HelloReturn Hello(Empty input)
        {
            return new HelloReturn {Value = "Hello world!"};
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
using AElf.Sdk.CSharp.State;
namespace HelloWorldContract
{
    public class HelloWorldContractState : ContractState
    {
    }
}
```

#### Testing

Now lets look at the test :

```bash
public class HelloWorldContractTest : HelloWorldContractTestBase
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Test()
    {
        var result = await HelloWorldContractStub.Hello.CallAsync(new Empty());
        result.Value.ShouldBe("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

### Adding some methods

The following content will guide you through adding some methods and state to the Hello World contract.

#### Modify the definition

Add the following to the "hello_world.proto" right after the **Hello** rpc method:

```bash
rpc Visit (Visitor) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) { }
rpc GetVisitors (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (VisitorList) { }
```

and the following two messages, after the **HelloReturn** message:

```bash
message Visitor {
    string Name = 1;
}

message VisitorList {
    repeated string Names = 1;
}
```

Note: assuming you're at the root of AElf Boilerplate's clone, execute the following command to generate the protobuf messages and service base on the definition we just extended:

```bash
cd chain/src/HelloWorldContract/
dotnet build
```

If everything went well you should see the build log show ```Build succeeded.```

#### Implement the logic and state

The first step is to add some state to our state definition. Open the **src/HelloWorldContract/HelloWorldContractState.cs** and add the following property to the **HelloWorldContractState** class:

```csharp
public SingletonState<VisitorList> Visitors { get; set; }
```

Override the service/contract methods previously define to **src/HelloWorldContract/HelloWorldContract**

```csharp
public override Empty Visit(Visitor visitor)
{
    if (State.Visitors.Value == null)
        State.Visitors.Value = new VisitorList();
            
    State.Visitors.Value.Names.Add(visitor.Name);
    
    return new Empty();
}

public override VisitorList GetVisitors(Empty input)
{
    return State.Visitors.Value;
}

```

Build everything:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Should be success.

#### Test

In the **Integrated Terminal** navigate to the test folder: 

```bash
cd ../../test/HelloWorldContract.Test/
```

Add the following test to **HelloWorldContractTest** located in the **test/HelloWorldContract.Test** folder:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task VisitCall_AddsVisitorToVisitorList()
{
    await HelloWorldContractStub.Visit.SendAsync(new Visitor { Name = "Jon Snow"});


    var result = await HelloWorldContractStub.GetVisitors.CallAsync(new Empty());
    result.ShouldBe(new VisitorList { Names = { "Jon Snow" }});
}
```

```bash
dotnet test
```

You should see the following: 

```bash
Total tests: 2. Passed: 2. Failed: 0. Skipped: 0.
Test Run Successful.
```

<!-- ### MoreTesting

This way you can test your contract without running the node and test your scenarios programmaticaly. This will you most of AElfs internals so it's a very complete test. 
Here the logic is simple, but it gives you the idea. On your contract stub you can call any method on the contract.

Define a module:

```bash 
public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
    base.ConfigureServices(context);
                
    Configure<RunnerOptions>(o => { o.SdkDir = Path.GetDirectoryName(typeof(HelloWorldContractTestModule).Assembly.Location); });
    context.Services.AddSingleton<IRefBlockInfoProvider, RefBlockInfoProvider>();
}
``` -->

That's more or less everything. We recommend you write the contract in a test driven way, when you are ready you can run the launcher project and you will be able to call the contract through the RPC to start integration testing with some external client (or the CLI if you don't plan on building some sort of dApp).
