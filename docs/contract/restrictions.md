## Development Requirements and Restrictions

There are several requirements and restrictions for a contract to be deployable that can be separated into 3 categories;

1. [**Type and Namespace restrictions**](contract/restrictions/type.md)
2. [**Contract structure restrictions and requirements**](contract/restrictions/structure.md)
3. [**Compilation requirements**](contract/restrictions/compilation.md)
