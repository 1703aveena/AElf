## resources 

Tokens in AElf are divided into a few categories: native tokens, resource tokens and other user created tokens. The native token of the main net is ELF, currently we have the following resource tokens RAM, CPU, NET, STO.

ELF is the main token on the AElf platform, it is used for transaction fees, side-chain indexing fees, deposits for production nodes, and block rewards for production nodes.

The resource tokens are used by the developer to pay for the resource consumption of the application runtime. The developer needs to ensure that there are enough resources tokens to ensure the application runs normally. Use ELF to purchase the resource token and sell the resource token to ELF.

On the AElf platform, developers can create tokens, build their own token models and incentives.
