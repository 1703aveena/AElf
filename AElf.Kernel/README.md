A builtin demo of minimal AELF blockchain contains:

* A Tranaction implemented with dummy content.
* A PoW miner with nBits(difficulty) equal to 1.
* A FIFO for TX sender & receiver
* A FIFO for block sender & receiver
* A scheduler makes the transaction execute asynchronously but locally.
* A Reducer collects all the results from workers.
* A worldstate built on memory key-value set(Dictionary).

(working in progress).
